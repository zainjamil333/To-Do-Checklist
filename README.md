# To-Do-Checklist

Introduction
The To-Do Checklist project is a simple web application designed to help users organize their daily tasks efficiently. The application allows users to add, categorize, and manage their tasks interactively. This report outlines the development process, features, and technologies used in the project.

Project Objectives
Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing tasks.
Allow users to add tasks with optional categories and names.
Enable users to mark tasks as completed and remove them as needed.
Provide a responsive and visually appealing design.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the web page.
CSS: For styling and layout.
JavaScript: For dynamic functionality and user interaction.
Development Process
Planning and Design
The project started with planning the core features and designing the user interface. Wireframes were created to visualize the layout, focusing on simplicity and usability.

HTML Structure
The main structure was built using HTML, including input fields for tasks, a category selector, and a section to display the task list. An informative section was added to educate users about the benefits of to-do lists.

Styling with CSS
CSS was used to enhance the visual appeal, making the application clean and modern. Responsive design principles were applied to ensure usability on different devices.

JavaScript Functionality
JavaScript was implemented to handle user interactions:

Adding new tasks with a name and category.
Dynamically creating task elements with checkboxes and delete buttons.
Marking tasks as completed.
Removing tasks from the list.
Handling input events for better user experience.
Testing and Debugging
The application was tested across different browsers and devices to ensure consistent behavior and appearance.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can enter a task, select a category, and optionally add their name.
Categorization: Tasks can be categorized as Work, Personal, Shopping, or Other.
Task Management: Tasks can be marked as completed or deleted.
User Guidance: An info section provides tips on effective task management.
Challenges Faced
Ensuring dynamic elements (like the name input) were added only once.
Managing event listeners for dynamically created elements.
Keeping the UI responsive and accessible.
Conclusion
The To-Do Checklist project successfully meets its objectives by providing a functional and easy-to-use tool for task management. The project improved my skills in front-end development, especially in DOM manipulation and event handling with JavaScript.

Future Improvements
Add persistent storage using localStorage or a backend.
Implement task editing and due dates.
Enhance accessibility for all users.
